# Overview
This is the accompanying research data and code for the paper de Guzman et al. (2026) - "Whole-stream wastewater addition stimulates the green food web pathway but does not affect food chain length" published in Hydrobiologia. DOI: 10.1007/s10750-025-06103-w

A study was conducted to assess the effects of WWTP effluent on stream food webs. An ecosystem-level manipulation experiment was conducted following a BACI (Before-After/Control-Impact) design, where part of the effluent of a large tertiary urban WWTP was diverted into a small nearly unpolluted stream to assess its effects on trophic pathways of riverine food webs.  Contribution of basal resources to the diets of primary consumers and FCL were measured. 

Six datasets are provided as well as the code used to conduct the main analyses.
